# askap_targets
Main files used for the website http://www.physics.usyd.edu.au/askap_targets/ used by the FLASH team in ASKAP-BETA early science commissioning (e.g. target selection).

These files will NOT WORK if downloaded from here because you need the database, image files, etc, plus a specific setup of Python. But these are the files as found on the website, sans any sensitive information. Merely for record's sake and access.

Thanks to Cormac Purcell for various functions and the structure of this code.
